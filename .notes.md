# Misc Notes

### Trusts
NHS trusts are a broad organisational unit of care in the NHS. Of these, several types exist covering various aspects of healthcare;
- Hospital trust
- Mental health trust
- Ambulance services trust
- Community health trust

*Trust accountability*

Generally, most trusts cover secondary care, which covers services such as elective care, urgent & emergency services & mental health care. ([see](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/introduction-to-healthcare-technology/the-healthcare-ecosystem)).

Being semi-autonomous, it is largely up to the trust itself to create and maintain a website holding various pieces of information important to a patient's care. This information should be conveyed in a clear, concise and readily accessible manner to maximise patients' access.

In particular, disabled groups are most likely to need to access information relating to their NHS care, and as such adequate accessibility must be considered a basic requirement. *add study about disabled access to information*

This project aims to assess whether this requirement is being met, and if not where NHS Trusts can improve to meet all their patients' needs.

### Web Accessibility

The primary set of guidelines for accessibility on the web are the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), including versions 2.0 published 2008, 2.1 published 2018 and 2.2 published 2023. Most accessibility tools conform to WCAG 2.1, as WCAG 2.2 was published too recently for tooling to become available.

It is worth noting that WCAG 3 is being drafted alongside the incremental updates to WCAG 2 - this update should push standards for accessibility on the web higher. This demonstrates that while the Web Content Accessibilty Guidelines are a strong set of rules to follow, conformance with the guidelines does not represent a perfectly accessible website.

*waffle about history of accessibility*

The guidelines added in WCAG 2.2 

As a mature set of guidelines, many tools already exist to help check websites against the published versions; however, tools covering the new success criteria in WCAG 2.2 are sparse due to its recent publication.

Additionally, full automated coverage of all WCAG success criteria is not reasonably possible, as several guidelines require some human judgement. This could be due to elements that *could* break a rule, but may be exempt (eg. alt text on purely decorative images), or it could be due to automated testing not being sufficient to validate that a rule was followed (eg. alt text accurately describes the image).

Ethical dilemmas also surround the issue of accessibility, particularly with recent advances in computer vision and artificial intelligence; a particular problem is that of automatically generating alternative text using image recognition software. [This paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461702.3462620) explores two strategies to generate alternative text, and found no easy ways to avoid the issues brought up by the use of computer vision.

## Methodology
### Obtaining a list of Trust websites
A script to scrape [The NHS' list of Trusts](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/nhs-provider-directory/) to obtain a list of trusts and their associated URLs was created. In total, it collected a list of 213 trust websites on 2023/09/28. This script detected that the NHS listing's page for [University Hospitals Dorset NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/university-hospitals-dorset-nhs-foundation-trust/) was missing the website URL, so this trust's website URL was retreived manually from the [NHS' services listing](https://www.nhs.uk/services/acute-trust/university-hospitals-dorset-nhs-foundation-trust/R0D). This URL was added manually to the list from [The NHS' list of Trusts](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/nhs-provider-directory/) to create the [final list of 214 NHS trusts](ref).
